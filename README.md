# RectangleCounter
The rectangle counter computes all rectangles within a hardcoded rectangular table.
The rectangular matrix is represented by numbers - inticating the length of the rectangles constituting the table. 
For example: 
```
              [[1]] is just a single rectangle [  ]
              [[1,1]] is [  ][  ]
              [[2,0]] is [      ]

              and so on...
```        
The rectangles are counted by indicating how many times all different possible subtables can be nested in the big table
(including the big table itself)
